</head>
<body>
Fortress Rest is a web application that implements <A
        HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer">RESTful</A> Web services to interface with
<A HREF="http://symas.com/javadocs/fortress/index.html?overview-summary.html">Fortress Core</A> and a directory server
like <A HREF="http://www.openldap.org/">OpenLDAP</A>
or <A HREF="http://directory.apache.org/apacheds//">ApacheDS</A>.

<h1>What technologies are in use?</h1>

Fortress Rest was built using established <A HREF="http://www.opensource.org/">Open Source</A> technologies including
<A HREF="http://cxf.apache.org/">Apache CXF</A> (web services stack), <A HREF="http://www.springsource.org/">Spring
    Framework</A> (glue), <A HREF="http://maven.apache.org/">Maven</A> (dependencies)
and <A HREF="http://java.sun.com/xml/downloads/jaxb.html">JAXB</A> (data binding layer) and runs inside any reasonably
compliant Java Servlets container.

<a href="org/apache/directory/fortress/rest/FortressService.html">Fortress Rest service</a> access control decisions are
enforced using <A HREF="http://symas.com/javadoc/fortress-rest/">Fortress Realm</A> which itself
uses declarative <A HREF="http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/5/tutorial/doc/bnbwk.html">Java EE Security</A> and <A
        HREF="http://static.springsource.org/spring-security/site/">Spring Security</A> policy hooks that are wired to
connect back to the Fortress access management APIs.

Fortress Rest is a <a href="http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/tools/webapps_1/">Java Web program</a>
artifact and is wholly dependent on <A HREF="org.apache.directory.fortress.core/package-summary.html">Fortress</A>
but also needs a <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_Directory_Access_Protocol">V3 compliant LDAP</A>
server like OpenLDAP or ApacheDS.
For more information on installing and setting up a directory server check out the Fortress README's in the
directory-fortress-core source package.

<h2>What can Fortress Rest do?</h2>

Contained within this application are Web APIs to perform authentication, authorization, administration, audit and
password policies.
The most important package in this system, <A HREF="org/apache/directory/fortress/rest/package-summary.html">org.apache.directory.fortress.rest</A>,
contains the public Web APIs that are called by external systems.

There is a one-to-one correspondence between a Fortress Core API and a Fortress Rest service. The Fortress Core
APIs are organized into 'Managers' each implementing a specific area of functionality within the Access Management lifecycle.
For a list of Fortress Rest services, see <a href="org/apache/directory/fortress/rest/FortressService.html">FortressService</a>.

<h2>How can I connect with Fortress Rest?</h2>

Clients have a choice in how to connect with the Fortress Rest services. Integration can occur using a
preferred Web service toolkit like <a href="http://axis.apache.org/axis/">AXIS 1</a>, <a
        href="http://axis.apache.org/axis2/java/core/">AXIS 2</a>,
<a href="http://metro.java.net/">Metro</a>, <a href="http://cxf.apache.org/">CXF</a>, <a
        href="http://static.springsource.org/spring-ws/sites/1.5/">Spring Web Services</a>,
<a href="http://wso2.com/products/web-services-framework/php">WSO2</a>, <a href="http://jquery.com/">JQuery</a>, etc, or
by using the Fortress Core APIs
themselves which have built in support for calling Fortress Rest.

The Fortress Core APIs plugs into its backend data repository (LDAP) using a simple facade pattern that
shields its clients from downstream details. The behavior of the Fortress APIs does not change based
on the route it takes.

<h3>Options for Fortress Rest service Integration</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Client uses Fortress Core to connect to LDAP via Fortress Rest:<br>
        Client-->Fortress Core-->HTTP/S-->Fortress Rest
    </li>
    <li>Client uses other Web frameworks to connect to Fortress Rest:<br>
        Client[Axis, Metro, CXF, SpringWS,...]-->HTTP/S-->Fortress Rest
    </li>
